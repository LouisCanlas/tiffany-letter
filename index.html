  <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

  <p class="note">*Tap any underlined word to listen to the corresponding song.*</p>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side—it really stayed with me. These are simple, meaningful things I thought would express my admiration and care—something personal that reflects your unique self.</p>

  <p>For the girl who defines "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34ceTg8ChN5HjrqiIYCn9Q?si=b7519486154b4d3e" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">Ms. Independent</span></u></a>" but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved—these are for you.</p>

  <ul class="gift-list">
    <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> – I had your name engraved to show it’s uniquely yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have—how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, unique, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don’t always see it, know I do. That strength—subtle but unmistakable—was one of the first things that drew me to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> – I got it with Miso’s name so you’d be reminded of the little things that bring you peace—the parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that’s something really beautiful to see.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Tiffany, before I leave, I want to be honest about what I feel—and where I stand. <span class="highlight">The truth is, a part of me still cares for you deeply.</span> That hasn’t changed. <span class="soft">I don’t expect anything, nor ask you to feel differently than you do now.</span> I know you’ve said you want to be single, and I respect that fully. <span class="soft">You deserve to live and love on your terms</span>—and I would never want to get in the way of that.</p>
   
  <p>I’d be lying if I said I don’t still wonder what it’d be like to take you on a real date—to know you in that way. It’s not something I dwell on with expectation—it’s just something that still lives quietly in my heart. I hold it gently, not because I’m waiting on you, but because you’ve meant something real to me.</p>

  <p><span class="soft">You didn’t ask for my feelings. I chose to care and to express them.</span> And even now, I don’t regret it—being around you reminded me of something I’d buried: a softer, more open part of myself I thought I’d lost. You helped me see that side again, and <span class="highlight">that’s a gift I’ll always be grateful for.</span></p>

  <p>I also want to say I’m truly sorry if I ever made you feel pressured, even unintentionally. That was never my intention, and I regret if I made things confusing or uncomfortable. I’ve realized that even unspoken hopes can carry weight, and that’s not something I ever wanted you to feel.</p>
  
  <p>More than anything, I want to see you truly happy—in every way that matters. You’ve been through more than most realize, and yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. <span class="highlight">That’s strength, Tiffany.</span> Quiet and real. I admire that about you more than you know.</p>

  <p>While I’m away, I’ll focus on my own growth—healing, becoming more of who I’m meant to be, and moving forward. When I come back, I hope we can reconnect with open hearts and honest friendship, whatever form that takes. <span class="soft">If ever, down the line, you feel open to exploring something more, I’d love the chance to show you what that could look like.</span> But if that day never comes, I promise I’ll still be okay. 
  
  <div class="closer">I’ll still value everything we’ve shared and I’ll still care.<br><br> 
    And if the timing ever changes—I’ll still be here.</div>
  
  <div class="standout">If you ever let love in again, I hope it’s the kind that lasts—strong, safe, and beautiful. The love you deserve—one that fills your heart without weighing it down.</div>
  
  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>I’ll miss seeing you at work and hanging out—but more than that, I’m grateful for every laugh, every moment, every random thing you said that made me smile without knowing it. Whether life keeps us close or drifts us apart, I’ll always look back on you with a smile. I've said it before and I'll say it again: <span class="highlight">I’ll always be rooting for you.</span> I’m proud of who you are and who you’re becoming.</p>

  <div class="standout">You've got this. I believe in you.</div>

  <p><span class="highlight">If life feels heavy, or you ever really need someone—I’m here.</span> I'll always have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7FB6Nx7TK8y1Ke8dY6ROpQ?si=faffdb43694d48d5" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">soft spot</span></u></a> for you. You’ve been one of the sweetest and brightest parts of my life. Thank you for letting me see a small part of your world.</p>

  <div class="closer">
  To me, you’ll always be 
  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2zbq6eS68i4NIJWekIuW1s?si=hAx5mWSmQDW4_L3osqFSWQ" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">marilag</span></u></a>
  — graceful, strong, and quietly beautiful in every way that matters.
