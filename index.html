  <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

  <p class="note">*Tap any underlined word to listen to the corresponding song.*</p>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these small gifts. They reminded me of you, and I just thought they might bring you a smile. They‚Äôre simple and personal, things I thought you‚Äôd appreciate in your own way.</p>

  <p>For the girl who defines "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34ceTg8ChN5HjrqiIYCn9Q?si=b7519486154b4d3e" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">Ms. Independent</span></u></a>" but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved, these are for you.</p>

  <ul class="gift-list">
    <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> ‚Äì I had your name engraved to show it‚Äôs unmistakably yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have, how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, distinct, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don‚Äôt always see it, know I do. That strength, subtle but undeniable, was one of the first things that drew me to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> ‚Äì I got it with Miso‚Äôs name so you‚Äôd be reminded of the little things that bring you peace. The parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, because I noticed how you light up at even the smallest things. That‚Äôs something genuinely beautiful about you.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>There were a few things I didn‚Äôt get around to saying. No pressure, just some parting thoughts before I step away for a while.</span></p>

  <p>You‚Äôve been a really bright part of my days, and I‚Äôve always appreciated your presence more than I ever said out loud. You once said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not really there in the way that you‚Äôd probably want.‚Äù But honestly, you didn‚Äôt have to be. I never needed you to be anything other than real with me, and you always were. That honesty meant more to me than you probably know.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm not holding on. Just letting things be what they were and walking forward with peace. I‚Äôll miss the everyday moments, but I‚Äôll carry the good ones with me. They meant something.</p>
   
  <div class="section-break"></div>

   <div class="closer">As much as it hurts to say this, I‚Äôve realized I need to end our friendship not out of anger or bitterness but out of care for both of us. I feel too much for you to keep showing up in your life as just a friend. I need to let go in a way that protects my heart and respects the space you have always been honest about needing.</div>

  <p>Because of that, I won‚Äôt be reaching out after this not because I don‚Äôt care but because I do deeply. This is not about walking away in anger or closing the door out of spite. It is about choosing peace, giving us both room to breathe, and allowing me the time to let go in a way that is honest and kind to myself.</p>

  <p>I really did love you ‚Äî as a coworker, as a friend, and as a person. That was true for me, and I just needed to say it before letting go.</p>

    <div class="closer">
  To me, you‚Äôll always be

  ‚Äî graceful, strong, and quietly beautiful in every way.
</div>

    <div class="section-break"></div>
  
<p>While I‚Äôm gone, I‚Äôll be focused on growing and becoming more of who I‚Äôm meant to be. No looking back, just moving forward.</p>

<p>Tiffany, I hope life brings you peace, kindness, and people who truly see all the good in you. <span class="soft">More than anything, I want to see you happy, truly happy, in every way that matters.</span> You‚Äôve been through more than most people realize, yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. That‚Äôs a rare kind of strength: quiet, real, and admirable. You‚Äôve been one of the sweetest and most unforgettable parts of my life, and </span>I'll always have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7FB6Nx7TK8y1Ke8dY6ROpQ?si=faffdb43694d48d5" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">soft spot</span></u></a> for you.</p>

  <p>Thanks for being someone I‚Äôll always remember fondly and for letting me see a small part of your world.</p>

The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause, girl, you're amazing<br>
