    <h1>To Tiffany</h1>
    <p>
Tiffany,

I don’t know where life will take either of us, or if the paths we walk will ever circle back and meet again. But I do know that meeting you has left a lasting impression on my heart. You've lingered in my thoughts—not just because of the feelings I had, but because of the kind of person you are. There’s something in your strength, your laughter, and your quiet resilience that moved me more deeply than I expected.

This gift is simple, but it’s filled with meaning. The Batman necklace with your name is a gentle nod to the strength you carry within, even on the days that feel heavy. The cat bracelet represents the comfort and calm I imagine you find in your quiet moments—the ones I hope continue to bring you peace.

I never chose these gifts to win your heart. I chose them because I noticed and appreciated the little things about you—things that make you who you are. I wanted to show that I saw you, even in the quieter moments.

I realize now that it may have been unfair and selfish of me to keep holding onto hope for something more, especially when you’ve already shared where your heart stands. I never wanted to place that pressure on you—only to express what was honestly in mine. If that ever made things feel heavy, I’m truly sorry.

And yes—I loved you. Not in a way that expected anything back, but in a way that sincerely wished for your happiness, your healing, and your peace. Even if those things come from someone else. Even if I’m just a quiet memory one day.

You deserve someone who sees every beautiful part of you and gives to you with a full and open heart. While I once wished deeply to be that person for you, maybe that isn’t the role I’m meant to play in your story. And if that’s the case… I’ll learn to be at peace with that too.

So with a heart full of care, I’ll be quietly stepping back—not because I feel any less, but because I want you to have the peace and freedom to continue your journey, without any weight from mine. I don’t know what the future holds. I don’t know if our paths will cross again in some new light—but if they do, I’ll be hoping you’re smiling.

You’ve left a mark on me that I’ll carry with quiet gratitude. If this is where our chapter closes, then I’ll hold it close with warmth. But if life allows us to meet again someday, I’ll still be glad to see you.

Thank you for being a part of my heart’s story.
