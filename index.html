  <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

  <p class="note">*Tap any underlined word to listen to the corresponding song.*</p>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side‚Äîit really stayed with me. These are simple, meaningful things I thought would express my admiration and care. Something personal that reflects your self in a way words sometimes can‚Äôt.</p>

  <p>For the girl who defines "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34ceTg8ChN5HjrqiIYCn9Q?si=b7519486154b4d3e" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">Ms. Independent</span></u></a>" but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved, these are for you.</p>

  <ul class="gift-list">
    <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> ‚Äì I had your name engraved to show it‚Äôs unmistakably yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have‚Äîhow your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, distinct, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don‚Äôt always see it, know I do. That strength, subtle but undeniable, was one of the first things that drew me to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> ‚Äì I got it with Miso‚Äôs name so you‚Äôd be reminded of the little things that bring you peace. The parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that‚Äôs something really beautiful to see.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Tiffany, I just wanted to say some things I never got around to saying. Not to change anything. Not to put anything on you. Just to leave with a little peace and clarity.</p>
   
  <p>I never expected to feel so much for someone I never dated. But you mattered to me more than you probably realized. The way you laughed, the random things you‚Äôd say, how you made ordinary days feel a little lighter - I looked forward to seeing you. And I‚Äôm grateful for that.</p>

  <p>I know you‚Äôve been honest with me. You‚Äôve told me you want to stay single, and that you see me only as a friend ‚Äî and I respect that. More than anything, I want you to have space to heal and to figure out what you need, on your own terms. You don‚Äôt owe me anything. You never did.</p>

  <p>This isn‚Äôt about trying to hold on. It‚Äôs about letting go the right way. I guess I just needed to express it somehow. Even though I felt more for you than you wanted, I understand. I really do.</p>
   
  <p>More than anything, <span class="soft">I want to see you truly happy, in every way that matters.</span> You‚Äôve been through more than most realize, and yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. <span class="highlight">That‚Äôs strength, Tiffany.</span> Quiet and real. I admire that about you more than you know.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs hard knowing I‚Äôll be gone for six months, and you might not even be at the store when I return. I‚Äôll miss the small things ‚Äî the simple moments we shared. But I‚Äôm learning to carry them with me instead of wishing for more.</p>

  <p>While I‚Äôm away, I‚Äôll focus on my own growth‚Äîhealing, becoming more of who I‚Äôm meant to be, and moving forward. Thank you for being a bright part of my day, even if only for a while. I‚Äôll remember that with nothing but warmth. And wherever life takes you next, I hope it‚Äôs full of kindness, peace, and people who see all the good in you.</p> 
  
  <div class="closer">I‚Äôll still value everything we‚Äôve shared. I‚Äôll still care, just in a different way now. Even though it‚Äôs not how I would‚Äôve hoped, I‚Äôm still truly thankful.</div>
  
  <div class="standout">If you ever let love in again, I hope it‚Äôs the kind that lasts: strong, safe, and beautiful. The love you deserve, one that fills your heart without weighing it down.</div>
  
  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>I‚Äôll miss seeing you at work and hanging out‚Äîbut more than that, I‚Äôm grateful for every laugh, every moment, every random thing you said that made me smile without knowing it. Whether life keeps us close or drifts us apart, I‚Äôll always look back on you with a smile. I've said it before and I'll say it again. <span class="highlight">I‚Äôll always be rooting for you.</span> I‚Äôm proud of who you are and who you‚Äôre becoming.</p>

  <div class="standout">You've got this. I believe in you.</div>

  <p><span class="highlight">But if life feels heavy, or you ever really need someone, I‚Äôm here.</span> I'll always have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7FB6Nx7TK8y1Ke8dY6ROpQ?si=faffdb43694d48d5" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">soft spot</span></u></a> for you‚Äîyou‚Äôve been one of the sweetest and brightest parts of my life. Thank you for letting me see a small part of your world.</p>

  <div class="closer">
  To me, you‚Äôll always be 
  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2zbq6eS68i4NIJWekIuW1s?si=hAx5mWSmQDW4_L3osqFSWQ" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">marilag</span></u></a>
  ‚Äî graceful, strong, and quietly beautiful in every way that matters.
