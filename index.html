  <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

  <p class="note">*Tap any underlined word to listen to the corresponding song.*</p>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side—it really stayed with me. These are simple, meaningful things I thought would express my admiration and care—something personal that reflects your unique self.</p>

  <p>For the girl who defines "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34ceTg8ChN5HjrqiIYCn9Q?si=b7519486154b4d3e" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">Ms. Independent</span></u></a>" but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved—these are for you.</p>

  <ul class="gift-list">
    <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> – I had your name engraved to show it’s unmistakably yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have—how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, distinct, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don’t always see it, know I do. That strength, subtle but undeniable, was one of the first things that drew me to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> – I got it with Miso’s name so you’d be reminded of the little things that bring you peace—the parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that’s something really beautiful to see.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Tiffany, I just wanted to say some things I never got around to saying. Not to change anything, not to put anything on you — just to leave with a little peace and clarity.</p>
   
  <p>I never expected to feel so much for someone I never dated. But you mattered to me more than you probably realized. The way you laughed, the random things you’d say, how you made ordinary days feel a little lighter — I looked forward to seeing you. And I’m grateful for that.</p>

  <p>I know you’ve been honest with me. You’ve told me you want to stay single, and that you see me only as a friend — and I respect that. More than anything, I want you to have space to heal and to figure out what you need, on your own terms. You don’t owe me anything. You never did.</p>

  <p>This isn’t about trying to hold on. It’s about letting go the right way. I guess I just needed to express that, even though I felt more for you than you did for me, I understand now.</p>
   
  <p>More than anything, <span class="soft">I want to see you truly happy—in every way that matters.</span> You’ve been through more than most realize, and yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. <span class="highlight">That’s strength, Tiffany.</span> Quiet and real. I admire that about you more than you know.</p>

  <p>It’s hard knowing I’ll be gone for six months, and you might not even be at the store when I return. I’ll miss the small things — the simple moments we shared. But I’m learning to carry them with me instead of wishing for more.</p>

  <p>While I’m away, I’ll focus on my own growth—healing, becoming more of who I’m meant to be, and moving forward. Thank you for being a bright part of my day, even if only for a while. I’ll remember that with nothing but warmth. And wherever life takes you next, I hope it’s full of kindness, peace, and people who see all the good in you.</p> 
  
  <div class="closer">I’ll still value everything we shared. I’ll still care—just differently now. Even though it’s not how I would’ve hoped, I’m still truly thankful.</div>
  
  <div class="standout">If you ever let love in again, I hope it’s the kind that lasts—strong, safe, and beautiful. The love you deserve—one that fills your heart without weighing it down.</div>
  
  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>I’ll miss seeing you at work and hanging out—but more than that, I’m grateful for every laugh, every moment, every random thing you said that made me smile without knowing it. Whether life keeps us close or drifts us apart, I’ll always look back on you with a smile. I've said it before and I'll say it again: <span class="highlight">I’ll always be rooting for you.</span> I’m proud of who you are and who you’re becoming.</p>

  <div class="standout">You've got this. I believe in you.</div>

  <p><span class="highlight">But if life feels heavy, or you ever really need someone—I’m here.</span> I'll always have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7FB6Nx7TK8y1Ke8dY6ROpQ?si=faffdb43694d48d5" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">soft spot</span></u></a> for you—you’ve been one of the sweetest and brightest parts of my life. Thank you for letting me see a small part of your world.</p>

  <div class="closer">
  To me, you’ll always be 
  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2zbq6eS68i4NIJWekIuW1s?si=hAx5mWSmQDW4_L3osqFSWQ" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">marilag</span></u></a>
  — graceful, strong, and quietly beautiful in every way that matters.
</div>
