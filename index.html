  <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

  <p class="note">*Tap any underlined word to listen to the corresponding song.*</p>

  <p>I know we might not ever become anything more than friends, and as much as that stings a little, I respect where you’re at and how you feel. I'm sorry it took me this long to realize and accept that. <span class="soft">This is from the heart:</span> I’m really sorry if I ever made you feel pressured to reciprocate my feelings or put you in an uncomfortable position. That was never my intention, and I truly regret if it came across that way. Thank you for sharing your stories, your humor, and everything you’ve been through with me—it’s meant more than you probably realize.</p>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts that I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side—it really stayed with me. These are simple, meaningful things I thought would express my admiration and care, and I wanted you to have something personal that reflects your unique self.</p>

  <p>For the girl who is the definition of "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34ceTg8ChN5HjrqiIYCn9Q?si=b7519486154b4d3e" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">Ms. Independent</span></u></a>" but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved—these are for you.</p>

  <ul class="gift-list">
    <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> – I had your name engraved in it to signify that this necklace is uniquely yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have—how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, unique, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don’t always see it, just know I do. That strength—subtle but unmistakable—was one of the first things that drew me to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> – I got it with Miso’s name because I wanted you to look at it and be reminded of the little things that bring you peace—the parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that’s something really beautiful to see.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>You’ve been through more than most people realize, and yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. <span class="highlight">That’s strength, Tiffany.</span> Quiet and real. I admire that about you more than you know.</p>

  <p>More than anything, I just wanted to see you truly happy—in every way that matters. And I’ll be honest, part of me wished that maybe, just maybe, I could have been the one beside you in that happiness.</p>

  <p>And just in case this thought ever wanders into your mind—you should never feel sorry or guilty for not feeling the same way about me. <span class="soft">My heart chose this.</span> I allowed my feelings for you to grow because being around you reminded me of something I thought I’d lost—a softer, more caring side of myself that I had buried for a long time. You didn’t ask for any of this. I chose to fall for you, and I chose to tell you, knowing full well that you might not feel the same way. And even now, I don’t regret it—because you helped me rediscover a part of myself I never thought would return. That gift alone… it means more than you know.</p>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Tiffany, I want you to know I still have feelings for you, and I didn’t want to hide that. While I’m away, I’m going to give myself the space to heal and move forward. When I return, I’m not expecting anything — but I hope we can reconnect with clear hearts. Who knows what the future holds, but I’ll always be glad I got to know you. Along with this, I’ll be focusing on becoming the best version of myself—not only for me but so that when I finally meet the one for me, I will be the right person for both of us. And I truly wish you the best on your own healing journey. If you do ever find yourself ready to let love in again, I hope the love you find is the kind that lasts—something strong, safe, and beautiful. The kind of love you deserve. I hope it fills your heart without ever weighing it down.</p>

  <p>I’m going to miss seeing you at work and hanging out with you—but more than that, I’m grateful for every laugh, every moment, every random thing you said that made me smile without even knowing it. Whether life keeps us close or drifts us apart, just know I’ll always look back on you with a smile. I've said it before and I'll say it again but I’ll always be rooting for you. I’m proud of who you are and who you’re becoming.</p>

  <div class="standout">You got this—I believe in you.</div>

  <p>If life ever feels heavy, or if you ever need someone—really need someone—I’m here. I will always have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7FB6Nx7TK8y1Ke8dY6ROpQ?si=faffdb43694d48d5" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">soft spot</span></u></a> for you. You’ve been one of the sweetest, brightest parts of my life so far. Thank you for letting me see even a small part of your world.</p>

  <div class="closer">
  To me, you’ll always be

  — graceful, strong, and quietly beautiful in every way that matters.
