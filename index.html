    <h1>To Tiffany</h1>
    <p>
Tiffany,

I don’t know where life will take us, or what kind of story the universe has written for you and me. But I do know that meeting you changed something in me. You’ve stayed in my thoughts longer than I ever expected anyone to… and not just because I’ve felt something romantic, but because who you are—truly—has moved me in a way I can’t easily put into words.

This gift is small, but it holds meaning. The Batman necklace with your name is a quiet nod to your strength—your ability to keep going even when the world has tried to wear you down. The cat bracelet, a reminder of the things that bring you peace and comfort, like your little companion at home. I chose these not to impress you, but to show that I see you—not just on the surface, but in the moments you probably think go unnoticed.

I know you're still healing, and if I'm being honest, a part of me wishes I could be someone who helps you through that. But whether or not there's a version of this life where you and I end up side by side, I wanted you to know something clearly:

I loved you—not in a way that asks for something in return, but in a way that hopes for your healing, your happiness, and your peace. Even if those things come with someone else. Even if I’m just a chapter you glance back at once in a while.

You’ll always be one of the most beautiful parts of my story.  
And maybe one day, you’ll feel the same about me.

With all the honesty and hope in my heart,  
Louis
