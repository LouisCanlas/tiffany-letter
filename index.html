    <h1>To Tiffany</h1>
    <p>I know we might not ever become anything more than friends, and as much as that stings a little, I respect where you’re at and how you feel. This is from the heart: I’m really sorry if I ever made you feel pressured to reciprocate my feelings or put you in an uncomfortable position. That was never my intention, and I truly regret if it came across that way. Thank you for sharing your stories, your humor, and everything you’ve been through with me—it’s meant more than you probably realize.</p>

    <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts that I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side—it really stayed with me.</p>

    <ul class="gift-list">
      <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> – reminded me of that phone case you used to have—how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, unique, and quietly powerful you are, and even if you don’t always see it, just know I do (it’s actually one of the things that attracted me to you), and you should be proud of it.</li>
      <li><strong>Cat bracelet with Miso’s name</strong> – for the little things that bring you peace—the parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that’s something really beautiful to see. Whoever you end up with once you’re ready to venture back into love again will be lucky to experience that part of you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These aren’t meant to win you over or anything—they’re just pieces of you that stood out to me. Plus, I know you enjoy a bit of princess treatment, so… here’s a little of that too.</p>

    <p>While I’m away for the next 6 months, I’m going to focus on growing and becoming the best version of myself—for whoever I’m lucky enough to end up with one day. She deserves someone solid.<br>
    Just like you deserve happiness, love, and someone who really sees you for who you are.<br>
    I’m proud of who you are and who you’re becoming.<br>
    You got this—I believe in you.<br>
    And if everything ever goes wrong, I’ll be there for you, and I’ll be there with you.<br>
    If you ever need anything—anything at all—and don’t know who to go to, I’m here for you.</p>

    <p>You’re one of the brightest chapters in my life so far. Thank you for being you.</p>

    <p class="signature">—Louis</p>
