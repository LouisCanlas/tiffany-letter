  <h1>Dear Tiffany,</h1>

  <p>I know we might not ever become anything more than friends, and as much as that stings a little, I respect where you’re at and how you feel. This is from the heart: I’m really sorry if I ever made you feel pressured to reciprocate my feelings or put you in an uncomfortable position. That was never my intention, and I truly regret if it came across that way. Thank you for sharing your stories, your humor, and everything you’ve been through with me—it’s meant more than you probably realize.</p>

  <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts that I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side—it really stayed with me. These are simple, meaningful things I thought would express my admiration and care, and I wanted you to have something personal that reflects your unique self.</p>

  <p><strong>Batman necklace</strong> – I had your name engraved in it to signify that this necklace is uniquely yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have—how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, unique, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don’t always see it, just know I do. That strength—subtle but unmistakable—was one of the first things that drew me to you.</p>

  <p><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> – I got it with Miso’s name because I wanted you to look at it and be reminded of the little things that bring you peace—the parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that’s something really beautiful to see.</p>

  <p>I admire how hard you work, how much you care about the people in your life, and the quirky way your thoughts just pop out mid-conversation and make people laugh. I know you’ve been through some really difficult experiences in the past. And even though I may not know the full story, I see how strong you are for getting through all of it and still showing up with that same kindness and light. That’s strength, Tiffany—quiet and real.</p>

  <p>Whether you end up in a relationship again (that will be a very lucky person!) or choose to stay single and keep being your independent, radiant self, I hope you always feel loved and supported. I hope you keep giving that same light to the world, just like you gave it to me.</p>

  <p>You’ve been a lovely part of my days… and something tells me that won’t change anytime soon. I genuinely care about you—not just the idea of you, but you, as a person. Whether or not I’m someone you ever feel the same way about, I want you to feel seen, heard, and safe. That matters to me more than anything else.</p>

  <p>While I’m away for the next 6 months, I’m going to focus on growing and becoming the best version of myself—for someone amazing I’ll get to meet or maybe even cross paths with again. You deserve that too—someone who gets you, supports you, and brings out your smile without even trying.</p>

  <p>And if everything ever goes wrong, I’ll be there for you, and if you ever need anything, I’m here.</p>

  <p>And if someday, your heart ever feels differently… I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t still want to see where it could go. But for now, I’ll leave that thought floating gently in the background—no pressure, no expectations. Just a soft little “maybe.”</p>

  <p>I’m really going to miss you—but more than that, I’m grateful for every laugh, every moment, every random thing you said that made me smile without even knowing it. I’m proud of who you are and who you’re becoming. You got this—I believe in you. If life ever feels heavy, or if you ever need someone—really need someone—I’m here. Always. You’ve been one of the sweetest, brightest parts of my life so far. Thank you for letting me see even a small part of your world.</p>
