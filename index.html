    <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

    <p>I know we might not ever become anything more than friends, and as much as that stings a little, I respect where you’re at and how you feel. This is from the heart: I’m really sorry if I ever made you feel pressured to reciprocate my feelings or put you in an uncomfortable position. That was never my intention, and I truly regret if it came across that way. Thank you for sharing your stories, your humor, and everything you’ve been through with me—it’s meant more than you probably realize.</p>

    <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts that I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side—it really stayed with me. These are simple, meaningful things I thought would express my admiration and care, and I wanted you to have something personal that reflects your unique self.</p>

    <p>For the girl who says she’s independent, but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved—these are for you.</p>

    <ul class="gift-list">
      <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> – I had your name engraved in it to signify that this necklace is uniquely yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have—how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, unique, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don’t always see it, just know I do. That strength—subtle but unmistakable—was one of the first things that drew me to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> – I got it with Miso’s name because I wanted you to look at it and be reminded of the little things that bring you peace—the parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that’s something really beautiful to see.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You’ve been through more than most people realize, and yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. That’s strength, Tiffany. Quiet and real. I admire that about you more than you know.</p>

    <p>More than anything, I just want to see you happy—really, deeply happy, in whatever shape that takes. And truth be told, I wished I could have been that person who gives you that happiness, the person that never chooses to give up on you, the person who loves you the way you deserve, and loves you exactly for who you are.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: #cc1e5d; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.2rem;">
      Because you deserve that.
    </p>

    <p>And just so you know—you should never feel sorry or guilty for not feeling the same way about me. My heart chose this. I let my feelings for you grow because being around you reminded me of something I thought I’d lost—a softer, more caring side of myself that I had buried for a long time. You didn’t ask for any of this. I chose to fall for you, and I chose to tell you, knowing full well that you might not feel the same way. And even now, I don’t regret it—because you helped me rediscover a part of myself I never thought would return. That gift alone… it means more than you know.</p>
