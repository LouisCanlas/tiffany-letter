    <h1>To Tiffany</h1>
    <p>I know we might not ever become anything more than friends, and as much as that stings a little, I respect where youâ€™re at and how you feel. This is from the heart: Iâ€™m really sorry if I ever made you feel pressured to reciprocate my feelings or put you in an uncomfortable position. That was never my intention, and I truly regret if it came across that way. Thank you for sharing your stories, your humor, and everything youâ€™ve been through with meâ€”itâ€™s meant more than you probably realize.</p>

    <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts that I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable sideâ€”it really stayed with me.</p>

    <ul class="gift-list">
      <li><strong>1. Batman necklace</strong> â€“ reminded me of that phone case you used to haveâ€”how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, unique, and quietly powerful you are, and even if you donâ€™t always see it, just know I do (itâ€™s actually one of the things that attracted me to you), and you should be proud of it.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Cat bracelet</strong> â€“ for the little things that bring you peaceâ€”the parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and thatâ€™s something really beautiful to see. Whoever you end up with once youâ€™re ready to venture back into love again will be lucky to experience that part of you. And if you decide instead to just enjoy your single life for a while, like youâ€™ve mentioned before, I support that just as fully tooâ€”as long as youâ€™re happy, thatâ€™s what matters most to me.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These arenâ€™t meant to win you over or anythingâ€”theyâ€™re just pieces of you that stood out to me. Plus, I know you enjoy a bit of princess treatment, soâ€¦ hereâ€™s a little of that too.</p>

    <p>While Iâ€™m away for the next 6 months, Iâ€™m going to focus on growing and becoming the best version of myselfâ€”for whoever Iâ€™m lucky enough to end up with one day. She deserves someone solid.<br>
    Just like you deserve happiness, love, and someone who really sees you for who you are.<br>
    Iâ€™m proud of who you are and who youâ€™re becoming.<br>
    You got thisâ€”I believe in you.<br>
    And if everything ever goes wrong, Iâ€™ll be there for you, and Iâ€™ll be there with you.<br>
    If you ever need anythingâ€”anything at allâ€”and donâ€™t know who to go to, Iâ€™m here for you.</p>

    <p>Youâ€™re one of the brightest chapters in my life so far. Thank you for being you.</p>

    <p class="signature">â€”Louis</p>
