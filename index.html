  <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

  <p class="note">*Tap any underlined word to listen to the corresponding song.*</p>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts I thought of specifically for you. The idea came the night we had boba, when you shared that vulnerable side of yourself. That moment stayed with me. These are just small, personal things to reflect the admiration and care I‚Äôve felt for you, things that sometimes say more than words can.</p>

  <p>For the girl who defines "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/34ceTg8ChN5HjrqiIYCn9Q?si=b7519486154b4d3e" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">Ms. Independent</span></u></a>" but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved, these are for you.</p>

  <ul class="gift-list">
    <li><strong>Batman necklace</strong> ‚Äì I had your name engraved to show it‚Äôs unmistakably yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have, how your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, distinct, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don‚Äôt always see it, know I do. That strength, subtle but undeniable, was one of the first things that drew me to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Cat bracelet</strong> ‚Äì I got it with Miso‚Äôs name so you‚Äôd be reminded of the little things that bring you peace. The parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, because I noticed how you light up at even the smallest things. That‚Äôs something genuinely beautiful about you.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <p>Tiffany, I just wanted to say some things I never got around to saying. Not to change anything. Not to put anything on you. Just to leave with a little peace and clarity.</p>
   
  <p>I never expected to feel so much for someone I never dated. But you mattered to me more than you probably realized. The way you laughed, the random things you‚Äôd say, how you made ordinary days feel lighter. I looked forward to seeing you. And I‚Äôm grateful for that.</p>

  <p>You once said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not really there in the way that you‚Äôd probably want.‚Äù But you didn‚Äôt have to be. You never owed me that. I‚Äôm just sorry it took me this long to fully accept it.</p>
  
  <p>You‚Äôve always been honest. You told me you wanted to stay single and that you only saw me as a friend, and I respect that. You deserve space to heal, grow, and figure out what you need on your own terms.</p>

  <p>This isn‚Äôt about holding on. It‚Äôs about letting go the right way. Even though I felt more for you than you wanted, I understand. I really do. I just needed to express it, to leave with clarity and peace.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs hard knowing I‚Äôll be gone for six months, and you might not even be at the store when I return. I‚Äôll miss the small things, the way your presence made each day feel a little softer. But I‚Äôm learning to carry those moments with me instead of wishing for more.</p>

  <p>While I‚Äôm away, I‚Äôll focus on healing, growth, becoming more of who I‚Äôm meant to be, and moving forward. You were a bright part of my everyday life, and I‚Äôll always be thankful for that. I hope life brings you peace, kindness, and people who truly see all the good in you.</p>
   
  <p>Tiffany, <span class="soft">I want to see you truly happy, in every way that matters.</span> You‚Äôve been through more than most people realize, and yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. That‚Äôs a rare kind of strength, quiet, real, and admirable. You‚Äôve been one of the sweetest, most unforgettable parts of my life, and </span> I'll always have a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7FB6Nx7TK8y1Ke8dY6ROpQ?si=faffdb43694d48d5" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">soft spot</span></u></a> for you. Thank you for letting me see a small part of your world.</p>
  
  <div class="standout">If you ever let love in again, I hope it‚Äôs the kind that lasts: strong, safe, and beautiful. The love you deserve, one that fills your heart without weighing it down.</div>
  
  <div class="section-break"></div>

  <div class="standout">You've got this. I believe in you.</div>

  <div class="closer">
  To me, you‚Äôll always be 
  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2zbq6eS68i4NIJWekIuW1s?si=hAx5mWSmQDW4_L3osqFSWQ" target="_blank" class="interactive-link"><u><span class="emphasized soft-spot">marilag</span></u></a>
  ‚Äî graceful, strong, and quietly beautiful in every way.
</div>

  <p>Because of how deeply I feel for you, I‚Äôve come to realize I need to protect my own heart. As hard as it is, I have to step away from our friendship, not out of resentment, but out of self-respect, and to give you the space you need.</p>

  <p>If you ever find life too heavy or need someone who truly cares, you can reach out. I‚Äôll still be quietly rooting for you. I‚Äôm proud of who you are and who you‚Äôre becoming. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect. Just enough to be at peace with yourself.</p>

  <p>And if any part of this makes you upset, or if you feel the need to see me as the bad guy, I‚Äôll understand. If that helps you move on or feel lighter, I‚Äôll carry that weight without resentment. My feelings for you have always been deep and genuine, enough that your peace matters more than how I‚Äôm remembered.

  <div class="standout">Above all, I‚Äôm thankful our paths crossed. Because for a little while, you reminded me that I‚Äôm still capable of truly loving someone.</div>

  <p>If it helps to think I only liked the idea of you, I‚Äôll let it be that way. If it brings you peace, I won‚Äôt challenge it. I care about you far too deeply to make this harder than it needs to be. I‚Äôm also sorry I once told you I‚Äôd be there until you found someone else to love. I meant it then, but the truth is, I care about you more than my heart can take. I hope you can forgive me for stepping away now instead.</p>

  <div class="standout">And as my last request, just once and never again, allow me to say this:<br>
I loved you, Tiffany.<br>
Thank you for everything, even if it was never meant to be.</div>

 <p class="lyrics">‚ÄúAnd when Tiffany smiles<br>
The whole world stops and stares for a while<br>
'Cause, girl, you're amazing<br>
