    <h1>To Tiffany</h1>

    <p>I know we might not ever become anything more than friends, and as much as that stings a little, I respect where you‚Äôre at and how you feel. This is from the heart: I‚Äôm really sorry if I ever made you feel pressured to reciprocate my feelings or put you in an uncomfortable position. That was never my intention, and I truly regret if it came across that way. Thank you for sharing your stories, your humor, and everything you‚Äôve been through with me‚Äîit‚Äôs meant more than you probably realize.</p>

    <p>Before I go, I wanted to give you these gifts that I thought of specifically for you. I first got the idea for them the night you had boba with me and shared your vulnerable side‚Äîit really stayed with me. These are simple, meaningful things I thought would express my admiration and care, and I wanted you to have something personal that reflects your unique self.</p>

    <p>For the girl who says she‚Äôs independent, but still lights up just a little more when princess treatment is involved‚Äîthese are for you.</p>

    <div class="gift-list">
      <div class="gift-item">
        <strong>Batman necklace:</strong> I had your name engraved in it to signify that this necklace is uniquely yours. It reminded me of that phone case you used to have‚Äîhow your friends said it represented you. It made me think of how strong, unique, and quietly powerful you are. Even if you don‚Äôt always see it, just know I do. That strength‚Äîsubtle but unmistakable‚Äîwas one of the first things that drew me to you.
      </div>
      <div class="gift-item">
        <strong>Cat bracelet:</strong> I got it with Miso‚Äôs name because I wanted you to look at it and be reminded of the little things that bring you peace‚Äîthe parts of your world that make you smile, laugh, or feel okay, even for a moment. I notice you light up at the smallest things, and that‚Äôs something really beautiful to see.
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>You‚Äôve been through more than most people realize, and yet you still show up with a light in your eyes. That‚Äôs strength, Tiffany. Quiet and real. I admire that about you more than you know.</p>

    <p>More than anything, I just want to see you happy‚Äîreally, deeply happy, in whatever shape that takes. And truth be told, I wished I could have been that person who gives you that happiness, the person that never chooses to give up on you, the person who loves you the way you deserve, and loves you exactly for who you are.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; color: #cc1e5d; font-style: italic; font-size: 1.2rem;">
      Because you deserve that.
    </p>

    <p>And just so you know‚Äîyou should never feel sorry or guilty for not feeling the same way about me. My heart chose this. I let my feelings for you grow because being around you reminded me of something I thought I‚Äôd lost‚Äîa softer, more caring side of myself that I had buried for a long time. You didn‚Äôt ask for any of this. I chose to fall for you, and I chose to tell you, knowing full well that you might not feel the same way. And even now, I don‚Äôt regret it‚Äîbecause you helped me rediscover a part of myself I never thought would return. That gift alone‚Ä¶ it means more than you know.</p>

    <p>But whether it‚Äôs with someone else or on your own, your happiness is what matters most to me, and I hope life gives you all the joy it can offer. And if you are ever ready to venture back into the world of love, may that love you find be everlasting and everything you could ever wish for and more. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll pray happens for you every night until it comes true.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm really going to miss you‚Äîbut more than that, I‚Äôm grateful for every laugh, every moment, every random thing you said that made me smile without even knowing it. Whether life keeps us close or drifts us apart, just know I‚Äôll always look back on you with a smile. I've said it before and I'll say it again but I‚Äôll always be rooting for you. I‚Äôm proud of who you are and who you‚Äôre becoming. You got this‚ÄîI believe in you. If life ever feels heavy, or if you ever need someone‚Äîreally need someone‚ÄîI‚Äôm here. Always. You‚Äôve been one of the sweetest, brightest parts of my life so far. Thank you for letting me see even a small part of your world.</p>

    <p class="signature">‚ÄîLouis</p>
